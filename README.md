## _The consolidation challenge_!

**Here's [my page](https://nategithub9.github.io/)!**  (work in progress)

*What I learned:*

- Have a plan prior to work
- Use all the tools availiable 
- Use the web browser built-in developer tools to analyse your work
- Reach for help!
- Take breaks 
- Deploy the website early to test it on mobile devices
- Adding comments helps a lot on the way
- Use VSCode more efficiently
- Better understanding of Gitpages

*Areas to work on:*

- Positioning
- Accessibility and HTML testing while working on the page/website
